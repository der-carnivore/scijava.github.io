Welcome to SciJava
==================

SciJava aims to provide an overview of available Java libraries for scientific
computing. The packages listed are provided by individual projects each of which
is committed to co-operating with the other projects, reusing libraries and
integrating clients for a seamless workflow.

The focus at the moment is geared towards image processing, having begun during
the `2011 Fiji Hackathon`_ in Dresden, but other projects are welcome to get
involved.

**Features:**

-   Image processing
-   Image visualization and annotation
-   Worflow execution and machine learning
