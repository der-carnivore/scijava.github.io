Fundamental data types
======================

The following defined types are used in the subsequent sections.
Implementors should treat these sizes as minimium requirements.

.. note::
    **Roger Leigh**  Depending upon how we wish to persue
    interoperability between implementations, these may be required to
    be exact.  Using plain text would mitigate this to an extent.

    :header-rows: 1
    :file: gen/primitives.txt
    :delim: tab

.. csv-table:: C++ primitives
    :header-rows: 1
    :file: gen/primitives-c++.txt
    :delim: tab

.. csv-table:: Java primitives
    :header-rows: 1
    :file: gen/primitives-java.txt
    :delim: tab

.. note::
    **Barry DeZonia** Support different coordinate spaces as needed
    (int, long, double).  Should be possible to iterate some regions.
